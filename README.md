# DeskPins
For all of you still using Windows at times (thanks, Adobe..) and wanting that basic feature. DeskPins can be used to make any application topmost, that is, to keep it above all other windows. Just grab a pin from the DeskPins icon in the system notification area and click on any window. I really like this tiny software that does exactly what it says and should, no more no less and super lightweigt. I have not audited the source code at the moment so use at your own risk. Development seems to have stopped around 2015.
